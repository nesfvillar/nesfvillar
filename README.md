# Hello, I'm Nestor ðŸ‘‹

I'm an aerospace engineering student from Argentina, currently doing my 4th year of studies in the National University of La Plata.

## About myself

 Ever since I was 11 years old (I started programming in BASIC in a casio calculator!), I have been programming and learning to code.
 I like to create applications and tools that help people, and with the knowledge that I have gained over the years I think I am finally able to do so.

## What I know

The programming language that I feel most comfortable with is Python. I have been using it since 2018, and I haven't stopped learning it since then.

I also feel very comfortable with C, and in a lesser degree with C++.

I have used rust for part of the 2021 advent of code challenge, and I would love to continue using it for many other projects!

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning F#.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source projects!
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on myself.
